DRY & KISS Principles
    DRY = don't repeat yourself
    KISS = keep it simple stupid

array.reduce((accumulator, current value), 0)
    current value = changes depending on the element in the array
    0 = initial accumulator value

    Example:
    const prod = (numbers: number[]) => numbers.reduce((accumulator: number, currentVal: number)
    => accumulator * currentVal, 1)

slice
    (start, stop)
    (start) => goes until the very end
